## Elements that i think i have done well:

#### The Movie Card

I used tailwind css to design the cards because i have been working with tailwind css for some time now. Why tailwind css- easy to use and create components from scratch, easy customization

## Elements that i think i can do Better:

### Infinite Scrolling

I could add infinite scrolling and lazy loading for more performance

### using Redux

i could have used redux to store page Number used redux rtkQuery to fetch data.

### Showing More Details about Movies

i could have shown more details like Images and videos, and reviews and more stuff

## Feedback to improve this Challenge

#### WishList Movies

Let users to create a wishlist to store their fav movies in one place

#### Set up Login and Sign up

Let users create account and use database to store their fav shows and movies

#### Add tv shows

Adding tv shows to the app/test would also be beneficial.

#### Searching tv shows or Movies

Adding an option to search for either a tv show or a movie show or from both of them
